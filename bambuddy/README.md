## Configuration

| `trusted_frame_origins` | *(unset)* | Comma-separated list of origins allowed to embed BamBuddy in an iframe (`scheme://host[:port]`, no paths/spaces), e.g. `http://192.168.1.100:8123,https://ha.yourdomain.com` |
| `ha_url` / `ha_token` | *(unset)* | Point BamBuddy at a Home Assistant instance. Leave unset to auto-use this Supervisor's own Core API |

## Add BamBuddy to the Home Assistant sidebar

BamBuddy cannot be embedded via HA Ingress due to SPA architecture constraints. You can add it as a Webpage dashboard panel instead — see the [full documentation](DOCS.md#add-bambuddy-to-the-home-assistant-sidebar) for setup instructions, including the Cloudflare configuration for HTTPS users.
